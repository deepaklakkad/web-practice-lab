# Web Practice Lab 🚀

A structured, comparison-based learning repository to master **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** and modern frontend frameworks by building the **same projects across multiple stacks**.

Inspired by the idea of *learning by repetition with variation*.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is designed to:

- Strengthen **frontend fundamentals** (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Compare **styling approaches** (Vanilla CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap)
- Understand **framework differences** (React, Next.js, Angular)
- Build a **portfolio-ready** collection of mini-projects
- Practice **real-world UI & logic patterns** repeatedly

Each project is implemented multiple times using different technologies, while keeping the **problem definition the same**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> Same problem. Different tools. Clear understanding.

Instead of learning frameworks in isolation, this repo focuses on:

- What stays **constant** (logic, UX, problem-solving)
- What **changes** (syntax, structure, abstractions)

---

## 🧩 Project Categories

Projects are grouped into the following categories:

- **UI Components** – buttons, modals, tabs, cards
- **Forms & Inputs** – login, validation, multi-step forms
- **State & Logic** – todo, notes, quiz apps
- **API & Async** – weather, movie search, pagination
- **Advanced UI/UX** – drag-drop, infinite scroll, dashboards

## 📁 Folder Explanation

### 🔹 vanilla/
Contains projects built using **plain HTML + JavaScript**, with different styling approaches:

- `html-css-js` → Pure CSS
- `html-tailwind-js` → Tailwind utility-first styling
- `html-bootstrap-js` → Bootstrap component-based styling

---

### 🔹 frameworks/
Same projects re-implemented using modern frameworks:

- **React** – Component & state-driven UI
- **Next.js** – React with routing & SSR concepts
- **Angular** – Full-fledged framework with TypeScript

---

### 🔹 project-definitions/

This folder contains **framework-agnostic problem statements** written in Markdown.

Each definition includes:
- Problem statement
- Features
- Validation rules
- Learning objectives

These files act as the **source of truth** for every implementation.

---

## 📄 Project README Structure (Per Project)

Each project folder may contain its own README with:

- Project overview
- Features implemented
- Tech stack used
- Screenshots (optional)
- Learnings & challenges

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Daily progress is tracked separately using:

- Notion / Excel tracker
- Completion status per stack
- Notes & learnings per project

---

## 🧪 How to Use This Repo

1. Pick a project from `project-definitions`
2. Implement it using **Vanilla JS first**
3. Redo the same project using Tailwind & Bootstrap
4. Rebuild it using React → Next.js → Angular
5. Compare differences and note learnings

---

## 🎯 End Goal

By completing this repository, I aim to:

- Be confident in frontend fundamentals
- Understand *why* frameworks work the way they do
- Build scalable UI thinking
- Create a strong interview-ready portfolio
